    <p>HTML is a very important language used everyday in websites. To start, this is a
        basic example of some HTML starter code.</p>
        <br />
    <div class="coding">
        <br />
        <p class="code"> < !DOCTYPE html ></p>
        <p class="code"> < html ></p>
        <p class="code"> < head ></p>
        <p class="code"> < title >Page Title< /title></p>
        <p class="code"> < body ></p>
        <br />
        <p class="code"> < /body ></p>
        <p class="code"> < /html ></p>
        <br />
    </div>
    <p>
        First, the "DOCTYPE" tag declares that this is an html document. Next we have the
        html tag. There can only be one html tag in the document. All of our code must go
        in here.
    </p>
    <p>
        The next tag that we see is the "head" tag. This is the spot where are the "title" tag
        goes among other things. We will go into more detail about this area in the future.
        The title tag is what is displayed in the tab inside your web browser.
    </p>
    <p>
        Furthermore, the body tag is where all the information is displayed. This area is
        where most of your code will go. We will dive deeper in this topic in the future.
    </p>
    <div class="coding">
        <br />
        <p>Note: All tags must have a corespoding closing tag. It can lead to issues if the
        tags are not closed.</p>
        <br />
    </div>
    <p>
        Lets start with our own tag now. This tag is called the paragraph tag. It looks like
        this:
    </p>
    <div class="coding">
        <br />
        <p class="code">< p > Hello world < / p ></p>
        <br />
    </div>
    <p>
        It prints whatever is in between the paragraph tags. For this example, it says "Hello
         world." Now lets say you want a heading, then you would use a heading tag. There
         are 6 different types of headings, h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. A heading 1 would
         display some code like this:
    </p>
    <div class="coding">
        <br />
        <h1>This is a heading 1</h1>
        <br />
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="coding">
        <br />
        <p>Note: A heading 4 is the same size as the defualt paragraph tag.</p>
        <br />
    </div>
    <p>
        Now lets talk about the "Line Break" tag. This is used to add and extra line with no
        content. This is very useful in spacing. The format of the tag is as follows.
    </p>
    <div class="coding">
        <br />
        <p class="code">< br / ></p>
        <br />
    </div>
    <div class="button">
        <p><a href="page2.html">Next</a></p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
